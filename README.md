# [Cyclistic Bike Share Program Case Study] (https://github.com/Data944/R)
* Scenerio:Cyclistic bike-share program in Chicago features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. The director
of marketing believes the companyâ€™s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore,
your team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights,
your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members

# Summary of  Findings
* Saturday and Sunday has most riders compared to other days of the week
* Average ride length per day is higher for casual riders compared to members
* Average ride length from August 2020 to July 2021 was higher for casual riders compared to members
* Summer months most popular time of year to ride
* Average ride duration peaked in August and February for both casual and member customers
* The most popular bike is the classic bike,  followed by the docked bike and last is the electric bike for all customer types
*  Members take more trips with the classic bike and docked bike compared to casual customers

# Recommendations
* Members take more trips but the average ride length is less compared to casual riders and vice versa. It would be best to target casual riders who take more trips during the week to convert them to members
* Best to target casual customers year around, but especially during summer months
* Average ride duration peaked in August  and February for all customer types, best to target casual riders to convert to member status during these months
